- Desciption:

  “Personal Budget” is a software useful for personal budgeting using the so-called “double-entry bookkeeping.” See the end of this section for more detail and references.
  The software is created using Excel© and it uses a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to navigate among the different tabs.
  A User Manual is saved in the same repository to explain how to use all the functionality in the software.
  The software can be opened using Excel©. Macros need to be activated to properly run the program. Refer to the user manual for more detail.

  Caveat: The “printing” button needs to be set up since the printer must be assigned.

- References:

  Double-entry accounting is a system that requires two book entries — one debit and one credit — for every transaction within a business. Books are balanced when the sum of each debit and its corresponding credit equals zero.
